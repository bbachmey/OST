This is looking great!  The Shape class and the draw() method have been marked as abstract, which is perfect!

However, we won't actually be using methods to control the change, resize, move and remove actions, but those were good ideas.  

Stay tuned, you'll be writing a MouseHandler that will use the Model's state and the mouse to implement these actions.

There are also some changes that I requested in Homework 4 that would serve you well here.
