Create a new project named java3_Homework05 in your Java3_Homework working set. 
Copy your latest files for the Shape drawing applet into your java3_Homework05 project.

Look at the example project for this course and your homework submission for lesson 4.

You can keep your same design or change aspects of it if you have reconsidered. 
However, now that we have covered abstract classes you should make Shape an abstract class. 
Then consider what methods will be shared by all of the figures and what will not.

Consider which of these methods should be declared as abstract--in which case they will need to 
have the proper declarations in the Shape class and its subs. 
None need to be completely implemented at this time, but you can put comments into the methods 
so that you remember your reasoning when you get back to it.

When you feel good about your organization and design, submit java3_Homework05.
